// ðŸ§  Problem Statement:
//
// Design an object-oriented system that handles the scheduling of movie screenings, seat selection, and ticket purchases at a movie theater.
// âœ… Functional Requirements:
//
//     Users can:
//
//         Browse available movie screenings (by title or time)
//
//         View seating layout for a given screening
//
//         Select and reserve specific seats
//
//         Purchase a ticket (once seats are reserved)
//
//         Cancel a reservation before the showtime
//
//     The system can:
//
//         Track seat availability per screening
//
//         Prevent double-booking
//
//         Release reserved seats after a timeout (e.g., 5 minutes without purchase)

    return system.listAvailableScreenings()

    // at this point we probably want a mutual exclusive lock to prevent
    // anyone else from taking the seats of another user for some given time

      throw new Error("Sorry this movie is booked!")
