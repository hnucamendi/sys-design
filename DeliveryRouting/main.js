// ðŸ§  Problem Statement:
//
// Design an object-oriented system for a logistics company (like UPS or FedEx) that handles packages moving between distribution centers and delivery addresses.
// Your system should track where packages are, where they're going, and what state they're in.
// âœ… Functional Requirements:
//
//     Users can:
//
//         Create a shipment (with origin and destination)
//
//         Track their package (see current status and location)
//
//     The system can:
//
//         Assign a package to a route between distribution centers
//
//         Update package status: Label Created, In Transit, Out for Delivery, Delivered, Exception
//
//         Transfer packages between distribution centers based on location and distance
//
//         Route packages intelligently (e.g., shortest or fastest path)
